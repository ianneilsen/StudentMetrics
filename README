StudentMetrics

Academic Reporting meets Business Intelligence via Rails 3 and AJAX

StudentMetrics brings to schools a data repository to upload academic
data from many and varied sources. The data is then applied to school set KPI's and results are proudced.

The tools provide proactive dashboards on students, classes, year groups,
schools and teachers. These tools are useful for teachers, subject co-ordinators, curiculum advisors, admin staff, subject heads and the principal.

Reports can be exported as end of year academic transcripts or printed and handed to parents.

Results per student can be transferred to another school to help integrate the student into the system.

Students can carry their full academic results with them for life.
